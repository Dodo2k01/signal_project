DataStorage is the location of the dataset. It has three functions:storeData()
for adding new data,retrieveData() to get past records by patient ID, deleteOldData()
 to remove data after some time. The PatientData class keeps a record of each patient's
 vitals, a timestamp, and a version number to track changes. When needed, staff can
 access a patient's data using the DataRetriever class. It checks with AccessControl
 to make sure the user is authorized to access the information. This ensures that
 sensitive information are protected. PatientMatcher ensures incoming data from
 simulators or devices is correctly linked to the right patient. If there’s no match,
 it raises an error so that it can be dealt with. The Patient class holds basic info
 like the patient’s name, age, and history, which connects everything in the system.
