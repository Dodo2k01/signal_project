AlertGenerator checks incoming vital signs data, comparing it with the patient’s set
thresholds. If any threshold is exceeded, it generates an alert with the patient’s ID,
the condition, and a timestamp. The AlertManager then handles sending the alert to the staff.
The Staff class includes details like staff ID, name, and role,
along with methods like receiveAlert() to notify them and requestData() if they need
more information. Each patient has their own Threshold values, stored separately, so
the system is easy to update. This setup keeps the alerting process
logical, making it easy to manage and scale/update.
